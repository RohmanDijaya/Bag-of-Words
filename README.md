# Bag-of-Words

If you would like to try with an already made set, run predict with the file bof.pkl and test folder in the current directory. It will test the images with pretrained data. 

If you would like to train your own data, set a new path to your training images. 

first run feat.py to acquire descriptors vector

then run features.py to obtain clusters and classifier

lastly run predict.py to classify test images
